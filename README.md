A terraria mod that lets you scale the stats of enemies

*****
Forked by SpasD. 
Replaces integer inputs with floats to allow for more precise user input when setting multipliers for enemy health, damage, and armor.
Revision: replaces float inputs with integer percentage points to avoid float precision errors (250 --> 250%==2.5x)
